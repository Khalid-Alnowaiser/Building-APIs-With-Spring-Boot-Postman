Hey there!

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Building APIs From Scratch Using Spring Boot & Postman course. This repository is designed to provide you with a convenient way to access the code at any time.

The main branch contains the code for Day 1, while Day 2 and Day 3 have their own dedicated branches.

For those of you who are new to using Git, you can easily navigate through the branches using the commands "git checkout" or "git switch".

Additionally, if you want to keep your changes without committing them while moving between branches, you can utilize the "git stash" command.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment, and make the most out of your learning experience. Happy coding!
